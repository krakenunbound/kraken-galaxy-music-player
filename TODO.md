# To-Do List

## High Priority
- [ ] **Offline Support**: Remove dependency on CDN for Three.js. Install `three` via npm and update `index.html` import map or build process to use local files.
- [ ] **Testing**:
    - [ ] Verify "Sun" and "Effects" changes are rendering correctly without performance regression.
    - [ ] Test on Windows 11 Pro (Target OS).

## Code Quality
- [ ] **Modularization**: Keep monitoring file sizes. Ensure no file exceeds 2000 lines.
- [ ] **Documentation**: Maintain comments in code explaining "why" things exist.

## Future Features
- [ ] **Data Persistence**: Save settings and user preferences locally.
